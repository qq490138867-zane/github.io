  <h2>Production diary – Week 15</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 13 February 2026</p>

  <p>
    This week, I built and published my first version of my GitHub Pages website. I created the repository, edited the index.html file, and organised the basic structure of my homepage. I also added a Production diary section to reflect on my progress.
  <p>
    <strong>I am most happy with:</strong> The achievement I am most proud of is successfully deploying my website and seeing it live online. Understanding how GitHub Pages builds and publishes changes from the main branch made the process clearer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>I found it difficult to:</strong> I found it difficult to understand how the repository name affects the website URL and how deployment works in the background. I also found it difficult to structure the HTML content clearly at the beginning.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>I learn from this work:</strong> I learned more about the structure of an HTML document, including sections, headings, and paragraphs. I also learned how version control works in practice and why making small commits is useful.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Next time I want to improve:</strong> Next week, I want to improve my homepage layout, add more detailed information about my skills, and start creating a Projects section to present my work more clearly.
